# timetracker

A very simple timetracker solution which works together with
https://github.com/inofix/ch-inofix-timetracker
by exporting a compatible .xml.

(For the moment it is mostly just for my own personal use..?)

For the most easy recording of my working hours
the script just opens a text file with my favorite text
editor, and thanks to vim auto completion, I even
get proposals for reoccuring text, etc.

The format of the task records looks like this:

    =2017-07-27=
    com.example.timetracker
      0015 0045 "Create a timetracker import module"
    org.example.sub.task
      0045 0100 "Write an example task record"
